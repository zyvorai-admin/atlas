# Atlas documentation

**One API for the storage you have. A filesystem for the storage you need.**

Atlas is a storage control plane. It gives you one API and one console over the backends you already run (Ceph, Longhorn, ZFS, NFS and more), and it ships Atlas Native, a filesystem with NFS, SMB, S3 and CSI front ends for the storage you still need to build.

## A note on maturity

Lab verification is not production support. The [maturity status](./evaluate/status.md) page is the source of truth for what has been verified on real infrastructure and what is lab-only. When the roadmap and the status page disagree, the status page wins. Production use is covered by an enterprise [subscription](./evaluate/subscription-model.md).
