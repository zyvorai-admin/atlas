# Changelog

All notable changes to Atlas will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Versions
before `0.2.0` were not tracked here — see `git log` for that history.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0] — 2026-10-09

Documentation: a rewritten README with animated graphics, an animated landing page, and the full docs set published on the website.

### Added

- **Observe-first storage I/O sensor** (`crates/atlas-io`, binary `atlas-io-agent`):
  in-process bio pipeline (log2-µs histograms, cgroup/pid attribution, device→volume
  map, deterministic RCA, time-limited write-freeze leases that fail open). Default
  `ATLAS_IO_MODE=fake` so CI never needs `CAP_BPF`. Contract C sources live in
  `crates/atlas-io/bpf/`. `atlasctl io health|summary|histograms|workloads|rca|coverage|leases`.
  Optional DaemonSet: `deploy/k8s/atlas-io-agent.yaml`. See [docs/IO_EBPF.md](docs/IO_EBPF.md).
- **Live eBPF attach for `atlas-io`** (`bpf` feature, aya/CO-RE): block-layer tracepoints with
  queue time and error codes, plus the Atlas Native eBPF maps (per-process stats and a slow-I/O ring
  buffer), `GET /io/native`, `atlas_io_native_*` metrics and `atlasctl io native`. NFS, ZFS,
  io_uring and per-cgroup programs are still reported missing. Verified on a lab host (kernel 7.0).
- **Journal-mode and pool-mode RBD mirroring**: `mode=journal` enables and
  `GET`/`PUT /dr/pools/{pool}/mirroring`. A non-forced journal-mode promote needs
  `peer_replayed=1`, backed by `journal_peers_replayed` on the demoted site. Verified on the
  two-site Rook lab (`docs/DR.md`).
- **RBD consistency groups** (`/volume-groups`): crash-consistent group snapshots and a
  confirm-gated rollback job; migration `0035`. Local to one cluster; no released Ceph mirrors
  `rbd group`s across sites.

### Removed
- First-party **RustFS** product integration: `atlas-driver-rustfs`, Storage → RustFS console,
  `/rustfs/*` admin proxy, drive/instance jobs, vendored Helm subchart, and `deploy/rustfs-lab`.
  Object storage now defaults to Ceph RGW (`bkd_ceph_lab`). Bring-your-own S3 remains via
  `atlas-driver-rgw`. See `docs/RUSTFS.md`.
- Remaining RustFS leftovers: the ignored `ATLAS_RUSTFS_*` configuration and its startup warning,
  the `POST /backends/{id}/selftest` route (it could only ever answer "unsupported"), the
  `RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY`/`RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY` credential-alias shim, the dead `/rustfs/*` console hooks and
  types, and the `ATLAS_RUSTFS_*` block in `.env.example`. Kept on purpose so existing data still
  loads: the `BackendType::Rustfs` value and the retired `bucket.*.rustfs` / `rustfs.*` job variants
  (they are rejected with a clear error), plus the rejection of the `bkd_rustfs_lab` backend id.

### Fixed
- `POST /dr/mirrors/{id}/promote?force=1` was rejected with a 400 even though the docs and the
  guard's error message say to use it. `force` and `peer_replayed` now accept `0`, `1`, `false`
  and `true`.
- DataBridge docs and the console's engine table still called MySQL CDC-only and SQL Server and
  Oracle discovery-only; all six engines were verified through cutover on 2026-10-04.
- The Helm chart's `s3.caSecretName` (trust a private CA for a bring-your-own S3 endpoint) set
  `ATLAS_S3_CA_CERT`, but the code only read the legacy `ATLAS_RUSTFS_CA_CERT`, so the setting had no
  effect. The code now reads `ATLAS_S3_CA_CERT`. **If you set `ATLAS_RUSTFS_CA_CERT` directly, rename it.**

### Changed
- Relicensed from the Zyvor Production License v1.0 to the **Apache License, Version 2.0**
  ([LICENSE](LICENSE), SPDX `Apache-2.0`): use, modification and redistribution — including production,
  SaaS and managed services — are permitted under the license's terms; there is no longer a commercial
  license requirement. Source headers, Cargo/npm metadata, `NOTICE`, `docs/LICENSING.md`, the README and the
  website were updated; `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt` replaces the old license text. Releases already published
  under an earlier license keep the terms they were published with (see `docs/LICENSING.md`). The CLA/DCO now
  refer to Apache-2.0; the CLA's grant wording should be reviewed by counsel.
- README restyled as a landing page (blue/white hero with light/dark variants, capability tiles, Day/Night console overview).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-21

### Upgrade and migration notes

- No database migration is required from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0. Starting a 0.4.0 gateway applies the same `migrations/` or `migrations-postgres/` tree it already applied on `main`; this release does not add a schema revision of its own.
- Artifacts tagged `v0.3.0` stay under AGPL-3.0 plus the Atlas Commercial License. Artifacts tagged `v0.4.0` use `LicenseRef-Zyvor-Production-1.0`. The current [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) is the Apache License 2.0; the terms of older tags are those published at the tag.
- Helm lab installs keep the `localhost/atlas-gateway:dev` default. Published images are `ghcr.io/zyvorai/atlas:0.4.0` and `ghcr.io/zyvorai/atlas-ceph:0.4.0`, selected with [`deploy/helm/atlas/values-release.yaml`](deploy/helm/atlas/values-release.yaml). Do not deploy the floating `:latest` tag. A lab `scripts/deploy-remote.sh` roll-out of this tree reported `GET /version` as `0.4.0` (`/health`, discovery, and live StorageClasses also succeeded). That image is the local `:dev` import, not the GHCR tag, which is published only when `v0.4.0` is pushed.

### Changed — Zyvor Production License v1.0

- Replaced the AGPL-3.0 + Atlas Commercial License dual license with the [Zyvor Production License v1.0](LICENSE). Non-production use is free. Production, SaaS, managed services, OEM, and redistribution require a separate paid commercial license. Published SKU prices are withdrawn; commercial terms are issued separately ([https://zyvor.dev](https://zyvor.dev)). Source headers use `LicenseRef-Zyvor-Production-1.0`. There is still no runtime license key. The v0.3.0 AGPL text is [`LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-only-v0.3.0.txt`](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-only-v0.3.0.txt) (archived license texts were later removed from `main`, see [`docs/LICENSING.md`](docs/LICENSING.md)); the v0.3.0 commercial summary is [`LICENSES/LicenseRef-Atlas-Commercial-v0.3.0.md`](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/LICENSES/LicenseRef-Atlas-Commercial-v0.3.0.md).

### Added — operator Make targets

- `make help` lists targets. `make status` runs `atlasctl health`. `make deploy-remote H=<host> U=sus` deploys the gateway; `make deploy-ceph` deploys the real-Ceph gateway. `make ci` is unchanged.

### Added — NFS/ZFS real driver mode

- Added `RealNfsDriver`/`RealZfsDriver` alongside the existing fixture-only drivers, selected per
  backend via `ATLAS_NFS_DRIVER_MODE`/`ATLAS_ZFS_DRIVER_MODE` (`fake`, unchanged default, or
  `real`) — mirrors the existing `ATLAS_CEPH_DRIVER_MODE` Fake/Real split.
- Real NFS runs `showmount -e` to confirm the server is reachable and get its real export list; a
  configured export the server doesn't have is dropped, never fabricated. Per-export capacity comes
  from `df` when the export is already locally mounted, `None` otherwise.
- Real ZFS runs `zpool list -Hp`/`zfs list -Hp` locally on the gateway's own host (no remote/SSH
  support yet); a zpool that isn't actually locally importable is dropped, never fabricated.
- Both real drivers propagate a real error, never a silent fake-data fallback, when the target is
  unreachable. Helm chart gained `nfs.driverMode`/`zfs.driverMode` (default `fake`).

### Added — Cross-replica rate limiting

- `RateLimiter::allow()` stays synchronous and database-free (still safe to call from the gRPC
  path's `tonic::Interceptor`); cluster awareness now comes from a separate periodic background
  task (`ATLAS_RATE_LIMIT_SYNC_SECS`, default 2s) that syncs each replica's per-window count
  through a new `rate_limit_counters` table. An actor already over budget cluster-wide is denied on
  the next local check, even if that replica's own count hasn't hit the limit yet — eventually
  consistent within one sync interval. No effect on a single-replica SQLite deployment.

### Added — Atlas Ops Advisor

- Added `POST /api/atlas/v1/ai/advisor`: explainable risk scoring and prioritized, read-only
  runbooks from Atlas capacity, forecasts, recovery telemetry, alerts, and recent job failures.
- Added an optional OpenAI-compatible summary provider with HTTPS enforcement, bounded context and
  output, prompt-injection resistance, deterministic fallback, operator RBAC, and audit logging.
- Added local/provider mode documentation and unit plus REST/RBAC regression coverage.
- Added a Storage Center **Ops Advisor** page with question presets, explicit local/auto/LLM
  controls, risk visualization, evidence cards, and a prioritized non-executing runbook.
- Added `GET /ai/incidents` to correlate related alerts and recent failures into explainable
  incident families with bounded confidence and visible source signals.
- Added `POST /ai/what-if` plus console controls to compare baseline risk with capacity, growth,
  alert-resolution, and recovery-completion scenarios without changing live inventory.
- Added `GET /ai/anomalies` with model-free median/MAD detection for capacity, I/O, job, and alert
  surges; the console exposes explainable scores and adjustable sensitivity.
- `GET /ai/anomalies` now reports `telemetry_status` (`fresh`/`stale`/`unavailable`) and
  `latest_sample_age_minutes`, pausing detection with a warning when the latest sample is over
  15 minutes old or missing/invalid — an old spike is never presented as a current incident.
- Added `list_incidents`, `detect_anomalies`, and `what_if_capacity` MCP tools alongside
  `ops_advisor`, sharing one code path with their REST counterparts so the MCP edge can't drift;
  `GET /ai/incidents` also gained an opt-in `?mode=` narrative (local by default) reusing the
  advisor's existing OpenAI-compatible provider.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-14

### Changed — Dual license (AGPL-3.0 + ACL); remove trial JWT gate

- Open-source under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/LICENSE)
  ; commercial track via
  [Atlas Commercial License (ACL)](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md).
  The license notes that applied to this tag are [docs/LICENSING.md at v0.3.0](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/docs/LICENSING.md), not the current license document.
- Removed Ed25519 JWT trial stack: `atlas-license`, `atlas-license-tool`, gateway
  `license_middleware` / `GET /license/status`, `LicenseBanner`, deploy Secret wiring, and
  `ATLAS_LICENSE_ENFORCE`. AGPL self-host is ungated (same model as Aurora).
- Per-file `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only OR LicenseRef-Atlas-Commercial` headers;
  [`LICENSES/` at v0.3.0](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/tree/v0.3.0/LICENSES), [`NOTICE`](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/NOTICE), [`CLA.md`](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/CLA.md), [`DCO.md`](https://github.com/zyvorai/atlas/blob/v0.3.0/DCO.md);
  `make headers` / CI license-header lint.

### Added — Relay product ownership

- Document `relay` as an Atlas product consumer in `docs/PRODUCTS.md` (`owner.product=relay`,
  `resource_type=database`, `role=data_disk`). Relay keeps its Postgres ledger; Atlas provisions
  the data PVC and optional RGW backups. Implementation lives in the Relay repo
  (`docs/ATLAS_STORAGE.md`, `scripts/atlas-provision-relay-storage.sh`).

### Added — Apple.com-style console redesign

- Redesigned the React console (side rail, top nav, all 32 routes across 5 page templates) to a
  light/dark Apple product-page aesthetic, layered on top of the existing "Soundings"
  bathymetric UI identity. Verified live against the real-Ceph gateway.

### Added — GitHub-native CI/CD and supply-chain hardening

- Dependabot (cargo/npm ×2/github-actions/docker), CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates, `SECURITY.md`.
- CodeQL (JavaScript/TypeScript + Rust), `dependency-review` on PRs, OSSF Scorecard, PR-title
  and PR-labeler checks.
- `cargo-llvm-cov` / `vitest --coverage` as CI-artifact-only coverage (no external service).
- `rust-toolchain.toml` + `.nvmrc` pin the Rust and Node versions CI already resolves to.
- Every GitHub Action pinned to a commit SHA; every Docker base image pinned to a `sha256`
  digest; `npm install -g npm@<exact>` in both Dockerfiles.
- `docker-publish.yml` (GHCR push + keyless cosign signing + CycloneDX SBOM + Trivy scan) and
  `release.yml` (CHANGELOG-driven GitHub Releases + cross-platform `atlasctl` binaries + UI dist
  bundle), both gated on `v*` tags.
- Branch protection on `main`: required status checks, admin bypass preserved.

### Fixed — Security hardening

- Legacy `sha256$...` password hashes now upgrade to Argon2 transparently on successful login.
- Audit-log export refuses plaintext HTTP (loopback exempted for tests) — compliance-sensitive
  data no longer leaves the process over an unencrypted connection even if misconfigured.
- `cargo-deny` was silently scoped to `--all-features` by its GitHub Action's own default,
  defeating `deny.toml`'s documented default-features-only intent; corrected.
- Dependency bumps for known advisories surfaced once the above was fixed: `chacha20`, `h2`,
  `rustls` (RUSTSEC-2026-0285, published mid-development — TLS 1.3 handshake messages accepted
  across encryption level boundaries).

### Changed — README, docs site, social card

- Rewrote `README.md`: tech-stack badges, architecture diagram, "Why Atlas" comparison, Star
  History chart, new hero social card (`docs/social/atlas-share-card.svg`/`.png`, hand-authored
  from the project's own design tokens).
- Removed `Co-Authored-By` trailers from the full git history.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-25

### Added — Trial/licensing (Ed25519-signed JWT)

- Same design as sibling Zyvor products Veyron (`trial.rs`) and Aurora
  (`gtm_api.middleware.license`): a signed token carries who it was issued to and when it
  expires, verified against an embedded public key — no server-side clock, so deleting local
  state can't extend a trial. New `atlas-license` crate (verify/status, product tag
  `atlas-trial`) and `atlas-license-tool` (sales-only `keygen`/`issue` CLI).
- Gateway wiring: `license_middleware` gates the bearer-protected API with `402` once a trial
  expires; `GET /license/status` stays reachable alongside `/auth/login` and `/auth/oidc/*`
  so an expired install can still show *why*. `LicenseBanner.tsx` in the console UI.
  `Config::license_enforce` defaults to enforced (matching Aurora); local dev
  (`make run`/`make run-databridge`) and both `deploy/k8s/atlas-gateway*.yaml` manifests
  explicitly opt out until a real customer token exists. See `docs/LICENSING.md`.
- `Config::validate_for_start()` now warns (non-fatally) at boot if enforcement is on with no
  locatable token, instead of silently 402ing every protected route with no signal.

### Fixed — Cross-tenant write vulnerability across volumes, buckets, and direct RBD

A real, exploitable pre-existing gap: the tenant-scoping refactor (`require_tenant`/
`tenant_scope` in `auth.rs`) was applied to read handlers but never propagated to write
handlers. A tenant-scoped operator could create a volume or RBD image attributed to (and
quota-charged against) a *different* tenant, or expand/snapshot/clone/restore/resize/migrate/
flatten any tenant's volume or RBD image by id, or delete/prune/download any tenant's bucket,
backup, or bucket object — including minting a presigned S3 download URL for another tenant's
backup data. Fixed at every affected call site in `volumes.rs`, `object_store.rs`, and
`rbd.rs`; centralized in `object_store.rs`'s shared `bucket_s3_target()` helper so every object
operation is covered by one check. Admin-only operations are unchanged (admin is deliberately
global everywhere else in this codebase). New regression test
`operator_cannot_write_across_tenants` in `tenant_isolation.rs`.

### Added — UI lint, component tests, and CI gates

- `eslint.config.js` (flat config) for the gateway console — previously had none. CI now runs
  `npm run lint` + `npm run test` + `npm audit --audit-level=high` (previously only
  `npm run build`); the audit gate found and fixed 2 pre-existing high-severity advisories
  (nanoid, react-router) via a non-breaking patch bump.
- First component tests (`@testing-library/react` + jsdom) — `LicenseBanner.test.tsx`, guarding
  the licensed/expired/days-remaining states after that component shipped with zero tests and
  one real bug (see below) caught only by manual live verification.

### Fixed — License status couldn't distinguish "expired" from "never had a token"

Caught during live verification of the trial/licensing feature above, before it shipped:
`GET /license/status` reported an expired-but-authentically-signed token identically to no
token being present at all (`trial_expired: false` either way), because `jsonwebtoken`'s
built-in `validate_exp` rejected the token before its claims could be inspected. Since
`LicenseBanner.tsx`'s render logic branches on `trial_expired`, this would have silently kept
the "your trial has ended" message from ever appearing. Fixed by deferring expiry checking to
`atlas-license::status()` (which has the real `exp` claim to work from) instead of
`jsonwebtoken`'s decode-time rejection; regression-tested on both the Rust and TypeScript sides.

### Fixed — Real MySQL DataBridge CDC, unrunnable end-to-end before this pass

Live-verified `discover → full-load → cdc/start → validate` against a real Percona edge and a
real Kafka/Strimzi/Debezium stack for the first time; the code path had never been run against
live infra. Found and fixed 8 real bugs: `mysql_operator.rs`'s PXC CR builder never set
`allowUnsafeConfigurations` (blocks a single-node edge from ever reporting `ready`); `loader.rs`'s
`mysqldump` pipeline was missing `CREATE DATABASE` (target db doesn't exist yet), `--no-tablespaces`
(source creds lack `PROCESS`), `--skip-add-locks` (PXC's `pxc_strict_mode` rejects `LOCK TABLES`),
and `--set-gtid-purged=OFF` (conflicts with the edge's own GTID set); `streaming.rs`'s
`connect_spec()` used Strimzi's ~90s-to-kill default probe, too tight for a Debezium+JDBC Connect
image to boot; `streaming.rs`'s Debezium source config was missing `time.precision.mode: connect`;
`deploy/databridge/connect/Dockerfile` pinned Debezium 3.0.8.Final against a Kafka 4.3.0 base
image whose client library removed a method 3.0.8's schema-history recovery depends on
(`NoSuchMethodError`) — bumped to 3.3.0.Final. See `docs/DATABRIDGE.md` for two further
non-code operational findings surfaced getting a row to actually land on the edge: a failed
sink message permanently poisons its Kafka consumer offset (a task restart alone never skips
past it), and Debezium unconditionally encodes MySQL `TIMESTAMP` columns (not `DATETIME`) as
ISO-8601 strings the JDBC sink can't bind — a genuine open gap for any real schema using
`TIMESTAMP`, not yet fixed.
