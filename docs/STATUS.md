# Status

Short maturity matrix for Atlas 0.4.0. History and narrative live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
When the two disagree, this file wins.

A cell is **yes** only for that column. Lab verification is not production support. Nothing
below is bank or enterprise GA.

| Capability | Implemented and unit-tested | Verified on real infrastructure | Production-supported | Experimental | Planned |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ceph / Rook control plane (RBD, CephFS, RGW, jobs) | yes | yes, single-node Rook lab | no | | |
| NFS and ZFS drivers | yes, fake and real modes | no remote production target | no | real mode | SAN, cloud block, external Ceph import |
| Object storage (Ceph RGW default; bring-your-own S3) | yes | yes, single-node Rook lab (RGW) | no | | RustFS was previously a first-party backend (driver, admin proxy, Helm chart, console pages) — removed; see `docs/RUSTFS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` |
| Longhorn backend | yes, read-only (nodes/volumes via CRDs) | no | no | | native write path (PVC provisioning goes through the Kubernetes path today, not this driver) |
| Raw disk provisioning (ZFS pool via `zpool create`; Ceph OSD via Rook `CephCluster` patch) | yes, fake mode + safety-check unit tests + `GET /zfs/devices`/`GET /ceph/nodes/{node}/devices` picker endpoints | ZFS: **verified live end-to-end** on the lab host through the console — wiped a disk carrying a real, stale Ceph OSD partition table, then `zpool create` succeeded (`zpool status`: `tank0`/`ONLINE`, backed by the real device, zero errors). Root-caused and fixed two real bugs along the way: `zpool create`'s partition-reopen polls udev's device database (needs `/run/udev` hostPath-mounted, not just `/dev`), and the root/boot-disk check was blind to the host's real mount table in a container (needs a hostPath-mounted `/proc/1/mountinfo`, `ATLAS_HOST_MOUNTINFO_PATH`) — see `docs/DISKS.md`. Ceph: never run against a Rook cluster with the device-discovery daemon enabled (no Rook cluster on this lab host to test against) | no | yes — depends on the target Rook install running `ROOK_ENABLE_DISCOVERY_DAEMON` | stand up a Rook cluster to verify the Ceph OSD path; (pool destroy → wipe → re-provision was run live on the lab: `tank0` destroyed, `sdb` re-provisioned as `tank1`) |
| SQLite default, Postgres query layer, Helm `database.kind`, cross-replica rate limiting | yes | yes, CI `postgres-test` and `deploy/postgres-lab/` | no — needs a real HA Postgres | | enterprise IdP for OIDC (Dex lab only) |
| Auth, tenants, quotas, audit export, Vault resolution | yes | yes, lab (Dex, Vault, SIEM receiver) | no | | |
| DataBridge Postgres | yes | yes, through cutover | no | TLS still `sslmode=disable` | verified TLS migration |
| DataBridge MariaDB | yes | yes, through cutover | no | | repeatable CI/lab automation |
| DataBridge MongoDB | yes | yes, through cutover | no | | change-stream edge cases, repeatable verification |
| DataBridge MySQL | yes | through cutover, in-cluster on Rook Ceph, incl. `TIMESTAMP` columns and composite keys (2026-10-04) | no | | |
| DataBridge SQL Server and Oracle | yes | through cutover into CloudNativePG, in-cluster on Rook Ceph (2026-10-04); the Debezium initial snapshot is the full-load, validate is advisory | no | | rollback drill; Oracle TCPS |
| Cross-cluster DR (RBD mirror) | yes, incl. the clean-failback promote guard | yes, two lab Rook clusters: one-way (2026-10-04) and two-way with clean failback (2026-10-06), `docs/DR.md`; `dataplane_verified` stays a per-deployment flag | no | journal-mode and pool-mode mirroring | |
| Atlas Native filesystem (Raft metadata, EC, tiering, NFS/SMB/S3/CSI, replication, edge profile) | yes | yes, lab k3s and Rook Ceph (`docs/NATIVE_STORAGE.md`); no NVMe or RDMA benchmarks | no | yes | RDMA, GPUDirect Storage, IO500 submission |
| Ops Advisor, incidents, what-if, anomalies, MCP | yes, read-only | console exercised on the lab gateway | no | | persisted findings; no execution |
| eBPF storage I/O sensor (`atlas-io-agent`) | yes — fake source, histograms, attribution, RCA, fail-open leases, HTTP/Prom, `atlasctl io` | yes — aya/CO-RE block-layer attach, queue time and the Atlas Native maps against a real native cluster, on a kernel 7.0 lab host (`docs/IO_EBPF.md`) | no | live mode (`bpf` feature) | NFS/ZFS/uring probes, cgroup→volume map, Observatory heatmaps |
| Product integrations beyond gRPC `Owner` | gRPC owner surface yes | | no | | Transiva import, Veyron, GuestKit, PacketWolf, then a small SDK |

Transiva's owner id on the wire remains `hyper2kvm`. v0.4.0 does not rename it.

**Unresolved:** Zeus OS already has an `atlas` module ("Machine Finder") and a Storage Center
UI. Atlas does not yet absorb, replace, or sit beside that UI. Do not treat the names as settled.
